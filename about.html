        <h3>About Grace Hopper</h3>

        <!--copied from https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/18/margaret-hamilton-grace-hopper-presidential-medal-of-freedom/-->
        <p>Grace Hopper is best known for making arcane binary computer code accessible by developing English-like programming languages. She joined the Navy in 1943 and worked on the Harvard Mark I, an early electromechanical computer used to do crucial implosion calculations for the first atomic bomb. She also developed one of the world’s first computer manuals for the Mark I.

            While working on the Univac I computer in 1952, Hopper wrote the first-ever compiler (the A-0) which formed the basis for COBOL and paved the way for computer languages that followed. Hopper became a Navy rear admiral in 1985 and worked at Digital Equipment Corporation until her death, aged 85, in 1992. As the David Letterman video from 1986 shows, age never dampened her sharp mind, love of teaching technology and wit.</p>
